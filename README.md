# Custom Machine Learning Library

Welcome to my custom Machine Learning Library project! The primary goal of this project is to create machine learning algorithms from scratch, both supervised and unsupervised. While efficiency is a consideration, the main objective is to gain an in-depth understanding of how these algorithms work and to showcase my knowledge of Machine Learning principles.

## Project Overview

### Implemented Algorithms

In this ongoing project, I have implemented the following machine learning algorithms from scratch:

#### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

##### Incoming
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

#### Unsupervised Learning (incoming)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Ongoing Development

This project is a continuous effort that I'm pursuing in my free time to add more algorithms and enhance the existing ones. My dedication to this project reflects my passion for understanding the inner workings of machine learning algorithms and further solidifying my grasp of these concepts.

## Future Plans

I have ambitious plans for this library and intend to implement additional algorithms such as:

- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks (from scratch)
- Gradient Boosting Methods
- Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- And many more!

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand and improve this library.

## About Me

I am a passionate data scientist who thrives on challenges, and this project is a testament to my commitment to self-improvement and mastery of machine learning techniques. I'm excited to share my journey and progress with the community and welcome any feedback or collaboration opportunities.

Feel free to explore the code, ask questions, or provide suggestions. Your interest in my work is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to evolving this project into a valuable resource for the machine learning community.
